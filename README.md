# project-aether

A HTML5 Client for Club Penguin, built to be as close to the Flash game as possible, and to be compatible with Club Penguin version 253 (the latest one when it was shut down).
This means it can be used with original server emulators, such as <a href="https://github.com/solero/houdini">Houdini</a>, simply by switching out XMLSocket for WebSockets.

This is a side project by the 'Club Penguin Advanced' team.
